The idea is to build an open-book library system.  Users can register for it and exchange books with their peers. For example, consider a locality, if there are let's say 10 people who own books, these 10 people can join this platform and interact with each other for the book exchange. The aim is too build a community.



Phase 1:

1. It should also allow users to buy the books secondhand if needed. Initially, we will keep it simple and then improve the functionality. The user profile should display fields like the name of the book owner, name of the book, author, published date, price, book condition, and genre. We can store this in a database.

2. It should have two sections, "Lend a Book", "Find a book". Users can find people who are looking for a book using the "Lend a Book" feature. We need to make sure the owner has a book to lend. Users can find a book based on the genre they want through the "Find a book" feature.

3. It should also allow users to exchange their books with peers for a short duration. We can define a function that the user can set a date on which he/she wants the book back. For this we can have a reminder system that will notify the person who borrowed the book. In case of an exchange, both the users will have a reminder.

4. The interface should have functions(filters and search) genre, Author, price, book condition(manually written by the owner).

5. Users will create their profile and add all the books available with them(considering any condition of the book).

6. Users/borrowers can have an option to buy the book as well by chatting with the owner if an agreement is made.

 

Once we are done with this phase, we can add more functionalities to it. I want to do this in phases considering all the design patterns, data structures, database techniques, Low level design concepts. As of now we will only stick to Low level design.

   - **Filters**: Include filters for genre, author, book condition, price, etc., to refine search results.

4. **Lending and Exchange**:
   - **Lend a Book**: Users can lend their books to others. The system should ensure the book is available before lending.
   - **Exchange Books**: Users can exchange books with peers for a specified period.
   - **Set Return Date**: The lender can set a return date, and the borrower must return the book by that date.

5. **Reminder and Notification System**:
   - **Reminders for Return**: Send reminders to borrowers to return books before or on the return date.
   - **Notifications**: Notify users of any relevant activities (e.g., someone requesting to borrow a book).

6. **Buying and Selling**:
   - **Buy Books**: Users should have the option to buy secondhand books listed by other users.
   - **Chat for Negotiation**: Implement a chat feature where users can negotiate the price and finalize the sale.

7. **Communication Module**:

   - **Notification of New Messages**: Users should be notified of new messages in their inbox.

8. **Administrative Functions** (Optional for future phases):
   - **Admin Dashboard**: For managing users, books, and transactions.
   - **Reporting**: Generate reports on user activity, book transactions, etc.

#### **1.2 Clarifications Needed**

1. **User Roles**:
   - Are there different user roles, such as regular users and administrators? If so, what are the specific permissions for each role?
	As of now we will stick to only one user. We are not creating multiple users for the same profile. Just one Admin.

2. **Book Condition**:
   - How detailed should the book condition descriptions be? Are there predefined conditions (e.g., new, like new, good, acceptable)?
	Condition should consider these parameters(Physical appearance, page count, binding, text and illustration)

3. **Transaction Monitoring**:
   - How will transactions (lending, exchanging, buying) be monitored? Do we need to track transaction history for each user?
	Yes we need to track the transaction history of each user and should be stored in their profile. We can create a separate table for storing these transactions.

4. **Reminder System**:
   - What should be the frequency and method of reminders (e.g., email, SMS, in-app notifications)? Are there any specific timing requirements for reminders?
	Keeping it simple, we will have in-app notifications. Reminders should occur may be two days prior to the deadline.

5. **Scalability**:
   - Should the system be designed with scalability in mind, for future expansion beyond the initial community?
	Yes, we need to keep the system scalable.

6. **Data Privacy**:
   - Are there any specific data privacy concerns or regulations that need to be considered, especially regarding user data and communication?
	User data should be considered as private. We need to have privacy regulation defined.

7. **Payment Integration** (for buying books):
   - Will the system require integration with a payment gateway for handling transactions, or will this be managed externally by users?
	As of now, lets have an external payment method that the user will decide. We don't need to add it, we can if required but not now.

#### **1.3 Requirements Validation**

- Once these clarifications are addressed, ensure the requirements align with the project’s objectives.
- Discuss with stakeholders or team members to validate the requirements and confirm any assumptions.
